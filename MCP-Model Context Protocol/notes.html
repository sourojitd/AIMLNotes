        <h1>📚 My Notes on the Model Context Protocol (MCP)</h1>

        <section class="topic-section">
            <h2>🚀 What is the Model Context Protocol (MCP)?</h2>
            
            <h3>1. Core Concept</h3>
            <p><strong>Detailed Explanation:</strong><br>The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open-source framework introduced by Anthropic in late 2024 and adopted by major AI labs like OpenAI and Google.</p>
            <p>Think of it as a <strong>"universal language" or a "USB-C port for AI"</strong>. Its purpose is to standardize how AI agents (like ChatGPT) communicate and interact with external tools, data sources, and services (like your product, or Zomato).</p>
            <p>Before MCP, you had to build a custom "plugin" for each AI. Now, a product can build <strong>one MCP-compliant "server,"</strong> and <strong>any MCP-compliant "client"</strong> (like ChatGPT or Claude) can talk to it. This is what enables "agentic AI" — programs that can autonomously *take actions* for a user.</p>
            
            <article class="kid-card">
                <h4>🧠 Kid Card: The Universal Translator</h4>
                <p>Imagine your AI (ChatGPT) is an "English-only" customer. Your product (Zomato) is a "Hindi-only" kitchen. They can't understand each other.</p>
                <p><strong>MCP</strong> is like inventing a <strong>Universal Translator Device</strong>. Now, your kitchen (your product) just needs one device (the <strong>MCP Server</strong>). Any customer (any AI) with their *own* device (the <strong>MCP Client</strong>) can now place an order perfectly. It's the one standard that lets everyone talk.</p>

            <h3>2. MCP vs. RAG</h3>
            <p><strong>Detailed Explanation:</strong><br>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation):</strong> Is for <strong>information retrieval</strong>. It's a one-way street: "Go *get me* this information" (like from a PDF) so the AI can give a more truthful answer.</li>
                    <li><strong>MCP:</strong> Is for <strong>standardized two-way communication</strong> to *perform actions*. It allows the AI to *interact* with a service (e.g., "Add this to my cart," "Book a table").</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <article class="kid-card">
                <h4>🧠 Kid Card: The Library vs. The Assistant</h4>
                <p><strong>RAG</strong> is like a "Library Runner." You ask, "What's the news?" The runner *gets the newspaper* and gives it to you.</p>
                <p><strong>MCP</strong> is like a "Personal Assistant." You say, "Book me a flight." The assistant *uses tools* (like a phone and credit card) and *performs an action* in the real world. MCP lets your AI be an *assistant*, not just a *runner*.</p>

            <h2>🛠️ How to Move Existing Products on MCP (So AI Can Use It)</h2>
            <p>"Moving a product" to MCP means creating an <strong>MCP Server</strong> for it. This server acts as the secure, standardized "front door" that AIs can knock on. Here's how:</p>

            <h3>Step 1: Expose Your Product via an API</h3>
            <p>Before anything else, your product *must* have an <strong>API (Application Programming Interface)</strong>. This is the set of private rules that lets programs request info (e.g., <code>GET /products/123</code>) or perform actions (e.g., <code>POST /orders</code>). This is the "kitchen" the AI will talk to.</p>

            <h3>Step 2: Build Your MCP Server</h3>
            <p>The <strong>MCP Server</strong> is the new software you build. It sits *between* the AI (MCP Client) and your existing API. Its job is to be the "Universal Translator":
                <ol>
                    <li>It receives a standard MCP request from the AI.</li>
                    <li>It translates that request into a call to your *own* internal API.</li>
                    <li>It gets the response from your API.</li>
                    <li>It translates that response *back* into the standard MCP format and sends it to the AI.</li>
                </ol>
            </p>

            <h3>Step 3: Define the Server's "Capabilities"</h3>
            <p>Your MCP Server needs to tell the AI what actions it can perform (its "menu of services"). You define a <strong>schema</strong> (like an OpenAPI schema) that lists all available functions. For Zomato, this would be: <code>search_restaurants()</code>, <code>get_menu()</code>, <code>add_to_cart()</code>, etc..</p>

            <h3>Step 4: Implement Security & Authentication (OAuth)</h3>
            <p>This is critical. The MCP standard uses protocols like <strong>OAuth</strong>. Your MCP Server acts as an **OAuth Provider**. The first time a user in ChatGPT tries to use your tool, they will be redirected to *your* login page to grant permission. This ensures the AI can only access data the user has approved.</p>

            <h3>Step 5: Register Your Server with the AI (The "Client" Side)</h3>
            <p>Once your server is built and hosted at a URL (like <code>https://mcp.myproduct.com</code>), you need to tell the AI "hosts" (like ChatGPT or Claude) how to find it. This involves registering the server, for example, by adding its URL to a configuration file like <code>mcp.json</code>.</p>

                <h4>🧠 Kid Card: Putting Your Kitchen on MCP</h4>
                <p>You have a secret kitchen (your <strong>product</strong>). You want to let a famous "Food Critic" (the **AI**) order from it.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Install a Phone (The API):</strong> You put a phone in your kitchen so people *can* call in.</li>
                    <li><strong>Hire a Receptionist (The MCP Server):</strong> You hire a receptionist who speaks the "Universal Language" (MCP) and sits at a public desk (a URL).</li>
                    <li><strong>Write a Menu (The Capabilities):</strong> You give the receptionist a menu of *only* the things they can do (e.g., <code>order_pizza</code>).</li>
                    <li><strong>Get a Bouncer (The OAuth):</strong> You put a bouncer at the desk. When the "Food Critic" (AI) arrives, the bouncer checks their ID and gets their permission (the user logs in).</li>
                    <li><strong>Get in the Phonebook (The Registration):</strong> You tell the "Food Critic's" boss (the AI Platform) your receptionist's phone number so they know how to call you.</li>

            <h2>🌯 Example: How Zomato Uses MCP with ChatGPT</h2>
            <p>This is the real-world example of the steps above.</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>The User asks:</strong> "Find me a good biryani place near me and book a table for two."</li>
                <li><strong>ChatGPT (MCP Host):</strong> Understands the *intent*. It sees it has a "tool" (the Zomato MCP Server) that can `search_restaurants`.</li>
                <li><strong>Authentication:</strong> If it's the first time, ChatGPT asks the user: "I can do this with Zomato. Please log in to give me permission." The user logs into Zomato via OAuth.</li>
                <li><strong>The AI Takes Action:</strong> ChatGPT's MCP Client sends a standardized request to Zomato's server: <code>httpsU://mcp-server.zomato.com/mcp</code>. The request looks like: <code>{ "action": "search_restaurants", "params": { "query": "biryani" } }</code>.</li>
                <li><strong>The Zomato MCP Server:</strong> Receives this request, calls its *own internal Zomato APIs* to find the restaurants, and formats the list into the standard MCP response.</li>
                <li><strong>The Conversation Continues:</strong> ChatGPT gets the list and tells the user: "I found 3 places! 'Biryani Paradise' has a 4.5-star rating. Here is the menu...".</li>
                <li><strong>The User says:</strong> "Great, book a table for 8 PM."</li>
                <li><strong>The AI Takes Action Again:</strong> ChatGPT sends a *new* MCP request (e.g., <code>"action": "book_table"</code>). The Zomato server receives this, makes the booking, and sends back a confirmation.</li>
            </ol>
